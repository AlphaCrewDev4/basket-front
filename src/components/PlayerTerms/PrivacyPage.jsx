                <span >When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</span>

                <b><i>In Short:</i></b><i><span > We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</span></i>

                <span >We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at privacypolicy@hiwave.ai.</span>
                <h2><span >8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</span></h2>
                <b><i>In Short:</i></b><i><span > You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</span></i>

                <b>Withdrawing your consent:</b><span > If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section </span><a href="https://hiwave.ai/privacy-policy/#contact"><span >"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</span></a><span > below.</span>

                <span >However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</span>

                <b>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</b><span > You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, replying "STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE" to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section </span><a href="https://hiwave.ai/privacy-policy/#contact"><span >"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</span></a><span > below.

                <h3><span >Account Information</span></h3>
                <span >If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</span>

                    <li  aria-level="1"><span >Contact us using the contact information provided.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <span >Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</span>

                <span >Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.

                <h2><span >9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</span></h2>
                <span >Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</span>

                <span >California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</span>
